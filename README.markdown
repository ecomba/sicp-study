# SICP Study

This repository is meant to help me going through the [sicp](http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/) study. I have done this before and I have failed most of the times I went through the book. Most of those times was actually in silence by my own; time to change that.

I am going to try to solve the exercises in more than one language, but at first I will just
start using MIT-Scheme as the preferred language and then I will do it in clojure.
