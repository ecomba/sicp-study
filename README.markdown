# SICP Study Solutions #

With this repository I am sharing the solutions of the SICP study group we have just started
at Eden Development (http://www.edendevelopment.co.uk) as part of an attempt to study the
classic works.

I am going to try to solve the exercises in more than one language, but at first I will just
start using MIT-Scheme as the prefered language.

## Running the Exercises ##

I will add a rakefile to the exercises (that is probably because of my love to the Ruby language)
so that the code can be run by just calling the Rake script as so:

    rake

or
    rake test

## Notes ##

Some of the exercises are actually not coding exercises so I will just add my explanation to them
instead of the code.

Any feedback is very welcomed.

Enrique
